# UFO_Analysis
## Overview

I was tasked with inputting javascript code to get user input for date, city, state, country, and shape of the anomaly of possible ufos.

## Results

To use this webpage, you need to fill in the text boxes to filter through the table to see where ufos are appearing. The date text box filters when the ufo was seen. The city text box is the nearest city it was around when seen. The state text box was the state it was seen in. I know what you might be asking and that is about countries that do not have at state like canada. We input the equivilent to states which is a province. We also have a text box for the shape that it looked like. The description has all the information in more detail.

## Summary
The script works adequately and shows a preview of possible things to filter through. One draw back to the filtering is that you can't see possible countries the data has. This makes it hard especially trying to figure out the right abbrivation. I would recommend either a drop down filter or a way to say the entire countries name and still get the same results as inputting the abbrivation.
